# HonoursProject_YanPengGao

Pix2Pix.ipynb and Cyclegan.ipynb are used to start the training of the models
Test.ipynb writes the test results to /Output
As the components of the model are shared, discriminators and generators are in a 
seperate folder.
/data contains the images
/datasets contains the custom pytorch datasets
/models is where the saved model goes
/Outputs is the output of the images, it currently has results from Pix2Pix with Photo-Sketch

Note that a small random subset of Outputs are shown. The folders /data and /models are empty in order to upload to Github with size limits.
